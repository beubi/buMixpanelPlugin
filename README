This plugin aims to ease the integration of mixpanel into a symfony project!

The main features that I hope to invent time to make available:

- Bundle with the possibly required libraries
- Create a filter that automatically renders the necessary code
- Main configuration and identifications into yaml
- An abstraction class that eables the controller to track events, attaching properties and/or superproperties
- Provide a way to auto-track "actions" as events
- Integrate with the user in some way, to auto-include some properties of the user automatically in every event registration
