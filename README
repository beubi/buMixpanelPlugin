This plugin aims to ease the integration of mixpanel into a symfony project!


# Features:

- Bundles the javascript library
- Everything is configurable in yaml, app/mod/action levels
- Enables auto-tracking of all symfony actions and its parameters
- Allows to easily track an event and user properties
- Some view-layer helpers

# How to Install/Configure:

## Get a mixpanel account, if you haven't got one

http://www.mixpanel.com


## Install the plugin


For now, you need to download it into your plugins/ dir, but I will try to package it in PEAR soon

## Add buMixpanelFilter to your filters.yml file

        # insert your own filters here
        bu_mixpanel_plugin:
          class: buMixpanelFilter
          
## Configure your project token in your app.yml file

        all:
          bu_mixpanel_plugin:
            params:
              token: insertYourTokenHere

## Publish the plugins assets

        php symfony plugin:publish-assets
        
## Clear cache

        php symfony cc

        
# How to use

After configuring as explained above, it should automatically track your symfony internal actions and parameters

Just go to your mixpanel project page to see the actions being registered in real-time.

If you want a better control of what is tracked and how, here's the main things you can do:

- Set the param "auto_tracking_enabled" to false in your app.yml
- Set the global "enabled" to false in a certain environemnt or module
- Register your event manually using $this->getMixpanelTracker()->addEvent($eventName,$eventProperties);
- Set user-level properties upon login using $this->getMixpanelTracker()->addSuperProperty($propertyName, $propertyValue);


# TODO:

- Add helper for mixpanel platform, to generate charts to be displayed, easily
- Allow backend invisible event tracking without javascript
- Allow events to be configured in the module.yml
- Integrate with sfGuard for optionally auto-registering user properties
- Get feedback
- Test it in a real project
